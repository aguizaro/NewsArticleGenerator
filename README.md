## Satirical News Article Generator - API

This Satirical News Article Generator is a backend service designed to produce satirical news articles similar to those found on [The Onion](https://www.theonion.com/). Powered by ExpressJS running on a NodeJS server and backed by a MongoDB database hosted on an AWS [Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) VPS, this project offers a unique twist on current events.

Utilizing [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), it aggregates news articles, then employs OpenAI's GPT 3-turbo to generate humorous and satirical versions.
